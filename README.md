# gamer-resume
(PROJECT STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
A resume for gamers to social with each other. This is based loosely off of
[tiny-personal-resume](https://github.com/jessebot/tiny_personal_website), but
that is more geared towards coding professionals. This is entirely for fun! :D
Working demo available at https://domo.games.
